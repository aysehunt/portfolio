The exhibit featured an interactive touchtable. With my advisor, I iterated on existing touchtable UI in order to align with reading comprehension of children aged 6-13. Finally, I held feedback sessions with 25 middle school youth to refine exhibit prototypes and design."]},{"l":"Situation","p":["This project was a collaboration between the Adler Planetarium and Northwestern University. The team consisted of my advisors Dr. Mike Horn and Dr. Laura Trouille, and myself. This project was active from August 2021 to June 2022. It was a continuation of previous work by Obiorah et al. The previous team had designed and evaluated an exhibit at the Adler titled \"U!Scientist\".","Visitors interacting with U!Scientist. Credit: Obiorah et al., 2021"]},{"l":"Original Design","p":["The exhibit consisted of an interactive touchtable that prompted visitors to classify images of galaxies based on shape, size, and other characteristics. Visitors could gather around the table at one of 6 classification stations that looked like this:","Close-up of original U!Scientist exhibit user interface","Images were pulled from the Zooniverse Galaxy Zoo dataset. By engaging with U!Scientist, vistors are helping scientists classify huge numbers of images. The exhibit is part of a larger movement called people-powered research."]},{"l":"Task","p":["Based on the evaluation and insights from the Adler team, we identified that children struggled to use the existing exhibit without help from adults. Obiorah et al. suggested that the UI and instructional materials could be simplified to better suit a younger audience.","The goal of our project was to explore how to make the U!Scientist exhibit more engaging for younger visitors. In particular, the Adler was interested in cultivating meaningful experiences for students visiting the planetarium during field trips."]},{"l":"Design Challenges","p":["Before deciding how to tackle this task, I identified a few challenges that I saw as particularly relevant to designing for kids:","Images in the dataset have low resolution -- shapes can be ambiguous. This makes the images difficult to classify with confidence.","The task is open-ended -- users receive no feedback regarding the accuracy of their classifications after they are submitted.","The task is individualized-- there is no forcing function to make users talk to others or make decisions together.","These attributes make these image classifcation tasks difficult for anyone, but I hypothesized that younger users would especially struggle."]},{"l":"Action","p":["We opted to work closely with middle school students to understand their perspective on the exhibit and rapidly prototype new designs together. Our research plan was influenced by theories of participatory design-research (Bang and Vossoughi, 2016) and Guha et al.’s (2004, 2013) method of Cooperative Inquiry.","Participatory design research calls upon researchers to remove barriers between the researcher and ‘the researched’ to address structural inequality. Cooperative Inquiry outlines specific techniques for co-designing technology with children."]},{"l":"Methods v1","p":["Our team partnered with a local non-profit that runs a STEM-based afterschool program for K-8 students. Working with faciliators from the program, I created a tentative 8-week activity plan to introduce students to people-powered research and the Adler’s design challenge. I also secured funding and transportation for a field trip to the plantarium. I sought to position students as designers themselves, rather than users.","As an initial activty, I designed a quiz that took the essential elements of the classification task and gamified it. Users could vote for which shape best fit the image in real-time using phones or tablets. Afer the 30 second vote concludes, users can see the popular choice.","This approach had a few benefits. For one, it removed much of the scientific jargon that might be inaccessible to kids. Second, the quiz-based game increased the visibility of other people's choices. This encouraged kids to consider how their peers might be voting. This also introduces a social component, and an opportunity for debate surrounding the most popular choice.","After working with the non-profit for about 6 months, organizers let us know that due to the pandemic, attendance was too low to go ahead with our program. At this point, we went back to the drawing board."]},{"l":"Methods v2","p":["We decided to hold a 2-hour feedback session as a different afterschool program for 6-8th graders. The structure of the program allowed children to freely move between different activity stations, including a cooking station, a ping-pong table, and others.","We set up two protoypes and struck up conversations with middle schoolers about the activities and their interest in astronomy. The first prototype involved a stack of printed galaxy images and a categories on the wall. Students were asked to place each image in the category they felt it best fit:","Students could tape images onto the wall based on their shape","Our second prototype was a variation on the first idea. Instead of taping galaxy images to the wall, we asked kids to use tokens to \"vote\" for the shape of each galaxy image, displayed on a laptop screen:","Students could vote by placing a token in the box based on the galaxy's shape"]},{"l":"Result","p":["During our feedback session, students had mixed reactions to our prototypes. Between the two, students seemed to gravitate towards the wall-based prototype. Small groups formed as students tried to understand the task. A few asked us if this was some kind of game.","In one instance, a student, who we'll call J, had been hanging out near the wall-based prototype for a while. I had a chance to show J the basics of the image classification task. After a bit, J started talking to students who had just walked over.","J exclaimed to their peers, \"Let me show you how this works!\". J went on to show their peers how to categorize one of the images. J also pointed out other images on the wall that they had previously placed. One student questioned whether J had categorized the image correctly. At this point they looked to me, the researcher, for confirmation, and I explained that sometimes it was hard to tell and that they should just do their best. They debated for a while, before moving on to another activity."]},{"l":"Take-aways","p":["Based on this initial feedback session, I made the following conclusions for future work:","Increasing the visibility of the task, and the progress other people have made is important for drawing people in.","Creating opportunities for visitors to share and discuss decisions with others may help address the open-ended nature of the task.","I believe that designs that uphold these qualities, coupled with simplified language and signage, will improve engagement among younger visitors."]},{"l":"Acknowledgements","p":["This work was made possible by support from the Segal Design Cluster Fellowship at Northwestern University.

In addition to contributing to qualitative analysis, I ran statistical analysis in Excel and Stata and synthesized quantitative findings for publication."]},{"l":"Situation","p":["The project team consisted of Dr. Mmachi Obiorah, Dr. Mike Horn, and myself. This project began in January 2021 and is ongoing. This work is a continuation of prior work by Hu et al.","A child plays Osmo Coding on an iPad. Credit: Osmo Coding.","Our dataset consisted of 12 videos of children playing the commerically available iPad game Osmo Coding. Each video in the dataset is 30 minutes long and depicts a pair of first graders playing the game.","The objective of the game is to guide a character, named Awbie, towards strawberries that are hidden in a forest. Players accomplish this by constructing lists of instructions with physical blocks that include actions like 'forward' or 'jump.'"]},{"l":"Task","p":["The goal of our project was to compare how the design of a game influences the way children collaborate with one another. In particular, our data seeks to compare two different versions of the same game, shown below:","The key difference between these two versions of the game is the interface modality. In the tangible version, users manipulate physical blocks that fit together like puzzle pieces to give the character instructions. In the graphical version, users are given a second iPad with virtual blocks that they can connect on the screen in order to give instructions to the character.","My task, in collaboration with my teammate Mmachi Obiorah, was to conduct an analysis comparing how users collaborate while playing the two different versions of the game."]},{"l":"Action","p":["In compliance with the IRB requirements for this study, we obtained consent from parents/guardians to video record 12 pairs of children, ages between 5 and 8 years old, as they played both versions of the game. All pairs played each version for an average of 12 minutes, for a total session time of less than 30 minutes. We counterbalanced the order in which each pair played the tangible and screen-based version to control for order effect."]},{"l":"Qualitative Analysis"},{"l":"Actions and Talk","p":["We developed codes by watching the videos and paying attention to the way children manipulated game artifacts and talked to each other. The emerging codes from our initial observation of videos were organized into physical codes that included children’s physical interaction with game artifacts and with each other (e.g. blocking pieces, wrist grab, etc.) and verbal codes(e.g. turn talk, strategy talk and enjoyment talk).","To systematically compare what we saw, we divided each video up into 15 second windows. During each window, we asked ourselves \"do we see any physical actions or talk occuring?\". We recorded what we saw for in window. Codes can occur concurrently--a child could make an action (i.e. grabbing a piece) while talking (i.e. saying \"I have an idea!\") within the same 15 second window.","We iteratively refined these codes through discussions and analytic memos. Once we created an initial set set of codes, we started to watch vidoes from the dataset in 5 minute segments. We independently watched and coded the videos, then discussed any discrepancies. We continued this process until we reached agreement on every code (Cohen's kappa value of 0.7 or above). After achieving inter-rate reliability, we divided up the entire dataset and coded the videos in their entirety."]},{"l":"Disengagment","p":["To supplement our codes that described physical actions and verbal comments, we created another metric that we called disengagement. We defined disengagement as any instance of a child looking away, speaking off-topic, or walking away for at least 3 seconds. We coded the videos using the same procedure as our Actions and Talk codes."]},{"l":"Quantitative Analysis","p":["With our data qualitatively coded according to children's actions, talk, and disengagment, we used quantitative analysis to better understand patterns across the dataset. In particular, we sought to understand:","Are there differences in engagement between the two versions of the game?","Are there differences in engagement between the first half and second half of each session?","The goal of question 1 was to understand if there were significant differences between how children engaged with another while playing different versions of the game. We hypothesized that the tangible version of the game would allow more opportunities for both partners to engage and test out ideas at the same time. This hypothesis is informed by theories of tangible interaction, and how to design technology for collaboration.","The goal of question 2 was to understand how the order that children played the two versions of the game impacted their engagement. We hypothesized that children might be tired by the second half of the session, and that their engagement would change regardless of which version they played."]},{"l":"Result","p":["Our quantitative analysis revealed the following:","There was only a moderate difference in engagement between the two game conditions. Specifically, we observed similar levels of verbal engagement with both versions of the game. Perhaps unsuprisingly, we observed more physical engagement in tangible condition.","Our hypothesis regarding order effects was confirmed-- participants were significantly more disengaged in the second half of the session, regardless of the version they played."]},{"l":"Take-aways","p":["Our analysis did not reveal one version of the game to be significantly more engaging across the board. This work makes the following contributions:","We observed children using gestures and talk that have been noted in previous literature, replicating their results.","We made progress in determining the most effective methodological approaches for this kind of interaction analysis. In particular, future work should consider how they partition video data for analysis.","We observed that interface design significantly influences children's physical engagement with the product and one another. This warrants future work to explore this relationship."]}],[{"l":"Living Computers Museum"},{"l":"Evaluating visitor experiences in a museum exhibit"},{"l":"Summary","p":["In this project, I designed a mixed-methods study to evaluate visitor experiences in an existing museum exhibit. Through a combination of data analysis methods, I pinpointed a number of challenges within the exhibit. I translated these findings and my suggested solutions into a renovation proposal. I achieved buy-in from key stakeholders to move forward with my proposed design recommendations."]},{"l":"Situation","p":["This project was my final deliverable for my internship at Living Computers: Museum + Labs (LCM+L) in 2019. LCM+L is a computing history museum located in Seattle. LCM+L features a collection of restored vintage computers that are available for public use.","The Computer Room exhibit at LCM+L. Image credit: Wikipedia.","This project is focused on an exhibit called the Computer Room. This exhibit was designed to mimic an air conditioned room where mainframe computers would have been stored in the 1960s and 1970s. The Computer Room at LCM+L showcases restored mainframes that are available for public use, including a DEC PDP-10 and an IBM System 360.","Compared to other exhibits that featured minicomputers and vintage game consoles, the Computer Room exhibit has relatively low attendance. This had been demonstrated in previous visitor research at the museum, and confirmed anecdotally by staff. With a renovation on the horizon, the museum wanted to understand how visitor experiences in this exhibit could be improved."]},{"l":"Task","p":["The goal of this project was to make design recommendations to improve visitor experiences in the Computer Room. In particular, the museum was interested in improving experiences for people with no prior experience with mainframes and vintage computing--i.e. a non-technical audience. Additionally, it was important to provide design recommendations that took budgetary constraints into consideration."]},{"l":"Design Challenges","p":["Before deciding how to tackle this task, I identified a few challenges that I saw as particularly relevant to visitor experiences in the Computer Room:","The exhibit is behind large doors that are necessary for temperature regulation--it is physically separate and somewhat hidden from the rest of the museum.","The exhibit is not very welcoming--at its essence, the exhibit is a windowless room full of giant machines. Unless someone sees the signage, they might think they have accidentally entered a storage room.","The exhibit was very popular with vintage computing enthusiasts, just not with other visitors. It was important avoid making changes that would compromise the experience of visitors with technical expertise."]},{"l":"Action"},{"l":"Synthesizing Prior Work","p":["At the beginning of this project, I took time to synthesize prior visitor research that had been conducted at the museum. In particular, Bree Lohan's 2017 study had conducted a quantitative analysis of where visitors spend time at the museum.","Left: A map of the second floor of the museum, highlighting the Computer Room's location. Right: A heatmap of where visitors spend time, based on Lohan's quantitative analysis. Note the blue sections in the Computer Room, denoting low visitation. Image credit: Lohan, 2017","As part of her evaluation, Lohman conducted a time-motion study, which is visualized by the heatmap above. Results show that visitors spend an average of 7.64 minutes in the Computer Room. The modal visit duration for all visitors was around 2 minutes, suggesting that the average was increased by a few outlier individuals who spent closer to 10 to 12 minutes in the Computer Room.","Visitors under 18 and visitors who identified as women spent an average of 4.0 minutes and 6.0 minutes in the Computer Room, respectively. Average visiting time increased to 9.0 for visitors who identified as male. Visitors who interacted with the terminals spent an average of 11.9 minutes in the exhibit, regardless of gender. This data suggests that the space resonated more with certain groups of visitors, particularly those with enough technical knowledge to interact with the terminals."]},{"l":"Theory","p":["To supplement prior findings and guide the my data collection, I draw on John Falk's (2007) schema of visitor identities. His work suggests that visitor motivations for attending a museum can be understood through the lens of 5 identities:","Explorer: needs to satisfy personal curiosity","Facilitator: wishes to spend time with loved ones","Experience-seeker: aspires to experience the best things within a culture","Professional/Hobbyist: desires to deepen knowledge of specific subject matter","Recharger: hopes to recharge emotionally, physically, and spiritually","These identities are not absolute or finite, as one visitor could have a combination of these motivations at any time, or have distinct motivations on different visits to the same museum. I used this framework in tandem with visitor research data in order to make design recommendations."]},{"l":"Methods","p":["I collected three types of data to better understand visitor experiences:","5 interviews with tour guides and museum facilitators","6 tour observations, which included a total of 43 guests","70 survey responses, collected from visitors at the museum leaving the 2nd floor","Additionally, based on previously collected data and initial impressions, I identified three identities that are particularly relevant to LCM+L:","The Professional or Hobbyist identity is consistent with data related to visitors who have historically been the museum's core demographic—people with a passion for vintage computers. A 2017 member survey suggested that many original members of the museum participate in technology as a career or hobby, and that they became members because they believed in LCM+L's restoration work and mission.","The Facilitator identity relates to data that suggests the LCM+L has become more popular with families in recent years. A push to welcome visitors with children into the space saw a rise of family memberships, which now make up the majority of the museum's members.","The Explorer relates to data suggesting that LCM+L visitors strongly self-identify as curious, life-long learners. These visitors may have a technical background similar to the Professional, but because they skew younger than the Professional they typically lack the firsthand experience with many of the vintage systems at LCM+L. In other words, LCM+L is a way to learn about history, rather than reconnect with their past."]},{"l":"Result","p":["Here I will summarize a few important findings from the survey study, interviews, and visitor observation.","The survey indicated that 84.06% of respondents visited the Computer Room during their visit. This data is consistent with Lohman’s numbers from 2017. I believe there may be some inflation due to confusion regarding what the Computer Room is and is not. A common clarifying question during the survey was ‘Wait—what’s the computer room? Is it the whole second floor?’","As with any sample size this small, these results should not be held as statistically rigorous. Additionally, I didn’t ask about how long visits to the Computer Room lasted or what visitors did while visiting. If we assume the results from the 2017 time motion analysis to hold true, the average length of these visits were less than 8 minutes long.","This visual depicts written-in answers to the open-ended question, ‘what changes would you make, if any, to the Computer Room?’ This question was only posed to respondents who indicated that they had entered the Computer Room during their visit. Of the 58 surveyed, 16 visitors offered suggestions.","Notice the repeated mention of a desire to see video, interactivity, and tutorials in the space. Additionally, one person noted the need for tour guides to be mic’d in order to overcome ambient noise. This was something came up in interviews with tour guides, particularly when speaking to a larger group.","Finally, we posed a series of questions to visitors who indicated that they did not visit the Computer Room. We directly asked them why they did not visit the Computer Room. Not seeing the space and not realizing it was accessible to visitors were two of the most cited factors for not entering the Computer Room."]},{"l":"Design Recommendations","p":["After analyzing my data, I presented 3 main design recommendations to key stakeholders at the museum."]},{"i":"recommendation-1-increase-the-visibility-of-the-exhibit","l":"Recommendation 1: Increase the Visibility of the Exhibit","p":["35% respondents who didn’t visit the Computer Room reported being unsure if the space was open to visitors. 27% respondents who didn’t visit the Computer Room reported not seeing the space. These findings were supported by tour guides who reported visitors being confused about where they could go.","Small changes, like adding increased signage outside of the Computer Room could make a difference in the visibility of the exhibit. Directive lighting or floor decals are another option that could help guide people to walk towards the exhibit. The benefit of these changes is that they do not require a significant financial investment, yet they could yield measurable results."]},{"i":"recommendation-2-increase-awareness-of-restoration-work","l":"Recommendation 2: Increase Awareness of Restoration Work","p":["Based on interviews with tour guides, many visitors are unaware of the museum's efforts to restore vintage computers. A large amount of time and energy goes into sourcing machines, repairing physical components, and configuring software for visitors to use. LCM+L has an entire team of engineers dedicated to restoring machines and maintaining the collection.","To help visitors understand the ‘What’ and the ‘Why’ of the Computer Room, I suggest adding colorful inforaphics about what a mainframe is and how it fits in computing history. This information can help orient visitors without a technical background.","Additionally, adding more content that showcases the Engineering department (i.e. photos, bios, current projects, etc.), as well as LCM+L’s mission statement can help put the rest of the room in context. By pulling back the curtain on the context of this exhibit, we can demonstrate why this work is important.","Making changes to highlight restoration work would serve two important purposes. First, as previously mentioned, it would help orient visitors without a technical background. Second, information about the Engineering department and their restoration work would appeal to the museum's core demographic as well."]},{"i":"recommendation-3-create-opportunities-for-structured-exploration","l":"Recommendation 3: Create Opportunities for Structured Exploration","p":["As previous evaluations at the museum revealed, very few guests venture into the back corners of the Computer Room. I recommended that the museum explore the possibility of creating a clearly defined, numbered path with stops at each system. This would allow visitors to engage with the space independently, with enough structure to prevent becoming overwhelmed.","This structured path could include tutorials on how to use the machines, or other interactive activities. These changes would also address the survey suggestions of including more interactive activites."]},{"l":"Take-aways","p":["After my presentation, stakeholders at the museum including the curator approved my design recommendations to be incorporated into an upcoming renovation. Unfortunately, this project ended just before the pandemic and the museum closed its doors indefinitely due to public health concerns. The renovation remains on hold.","Still, the findings from this research remain relevant:","Visibility is key to attracting attention. This is a well-documented issue in exhibit design literature.","Context matters when trying to engage new audiences. Craft signage to answer questions like \"what is this?\" and \"why is this important to me?\".","Consider how to add points of entry for engagement.
