# Hello!

--![](/static/ayse-2.png/)

I'm Ayse \(pronounced like <a href="https://forvo.com/word/ay%C5%9Fe/" target="_blank">this</a>\). I am a mixed-methods researcher with a background in human-computer interaction and education. Through my research, I have 3+ years of experience guiding projects through their entire life cycle. I am passionate about designing physical spaces such as museum exhibits that utilize technology in thoughtful ways.
