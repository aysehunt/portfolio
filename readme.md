--![](/static/ayse-2.png/)

I'm Ayse \(pronounced like <a href="https://forvo.com/word/ay%C5%9Fe/" target="_blank">this</a>\). I am a mixed-methods researcher with a background in design, education, and software development.  Iâ€™m passionate about creating experiences that blend technology and physical spaces. In the past, I have worked with museums to research, design, and evaluate interactive technology in their exhibits.
