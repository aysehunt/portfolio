I'm Ayse \(pronounced like <a href="https://forvo.com/word/ay%C5%9Fe/" target="_blank">this</a>\). I'm a mixed-methods researcher with a background in learning science and human-computer interaction. Currently, I'm researching studentsâ€™ metacognitive practices and learning in introductory CS courses. In the past, I have worked with museums to research, design, and evaluate interactive technology in their exhibits.
