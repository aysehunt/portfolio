I'm Ayse \(pronounced like <a href="https://forvo.com/word/ay%C5%9Fe/" target="_blank">this</a>\). I am a mixed-methods researcher with a background in human-computer interaction and software development.  I’m passionate about creating digital experiences that are intuitive and that resonate with end users. Through my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees, I focused on developing educational technology. In the past, I have worked with museums to research, design, and evaluate interactive technology in exhibits.
