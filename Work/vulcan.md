# Improving the usability of an internal calendar tool

## Situation 

This project was part of my role with the Vulcan, Inc. Arts & Entertainment group. The team consisted of my colleague Brianna Lovest and myself. This project was active between September and December 2019.

Vulcan, Inc. is a holding company founded by Paul Allen based in Seattle. The Arts & Entertainment group oversees a number of organizations, including the Museum of Pop Culture, Fly Heritage & Combat Armor Museum, the Seattle Art Fair, and Living Computers: Museum + Labs. 

Leadership at the Arts & Entertainment group was interested in creating a calendar system to improve communication between the organizations in their portfolio. To test out a potential new format, Brianna and I were asked to create a Smartsheet-based calendar to unify internal communication at Living Computers: Museum + Labs. 


## Task 

Living Computers: Museum + Labs (LCM+L) is a computing history museum in Seattle. In addition to museum exhibits that are designed and maintained by curators and a team of engineers, LCM+L offers educational programming such as after-school programs and field trip activities. Also, the premises are available to be reserved for private events. Between events in the exhibits, educational programming, and private events, there is always something happening at the museum.

Brianna and I aimed **to create a Smartsheet calendar that would facilitate internal communication.** We collaborated with the following departments: Curatorial, Archiving, Engineering, Education, Marketing, and Operations. Additionally, the museum's operations were influenced by external events, such as holidays, school closures, and sports games at a nearby stadium.

It was important to the team that any solution we came up with would be easy for stakeholders within the museum and beyond to view and edit. Also, creating a system that was relatively simple to maintain was paramount. Finally, before presenting a final design, it was vital to get buy-in from all 6 department heads at the museum.

## Action

### Learning Smartsheet

In order to design a system that would suit the needs of the organization, we had to first understand what Smartsheet was capable of doing for us. We scheduled meetings with internal IT product experts, as well as Smartsheet's own product experts.

Through these meetings, we learned more about Smartsheet's dashboard feature, which allows users to create widgets that show a calendar in different views, lists, or submission forms. We learned that the dashboard would be a good way for internal and external stakeholders to view the calendar even without Vulcan login credentials.

Additionally, these meeetings help us become familiar with features that unique to Smartsheet, including the specifics of how sheet ownership and admin responsibilities are handled. This would become important to creating a sustainable, maintainable system.

## Result

The calendar was approved by all department heads and organizational leadership. Using principles of change management, Brianna and I facilitated the roll-out of the new system, and were on hand to answer any questions. Months later when I checked-in with my former supervisor, the organizational was still using the calendar.
